# EE5120_Course_Project
This repository holds the content created for the project in the course EE5120 (Applied Linear Algebra) by Dr.Uday Khankhoje at IIT Madras.

The paper chosen for implementation and report is [Matrix Completion using Schatten capped p Norm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9025071) applied to the setting of image restoration.

The report for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/KKamaleshKumar/EE5120_Course_Project/blob/master/SchattenCappedPnorm.pdf).

The slides used for the presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/KKamaleshKumar/EE5120_Course_Project/blob/master/SchattenCapped_pNorm.pdf)

The implementation of the algorithm is [here](https://github.com/KKamaleshKumar/EE5120_Course_Project/blob/master/SchattenCappedNorm.ipynb)
